# ![GBA Pong](https://returnnull.de/images/pong_github.png) (Butano Edition)

[![Compiled GBA file](https://github.com/tolik518/GBA_Pong_butano_edition/actions/workflows/compile_gba.yml/badge.svg?)](https://github.com/tolik518/GBA_Pong_butano_edition/actions/workflows/compile_gba.yml)

Just a version of Pong for Game Boy Advance. In contrast to my old [GBA Pong](https://github.com/tolik518/GBA_Pong) version, this project was written in C++ and the [butano engine](https://github.com/GValiente/butano).
